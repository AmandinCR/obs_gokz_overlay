### Notes:
- run overlay.py in the terminal once everything is setup.
- overlay.py will automatically upload download amandin.txt (data containing times/maps)
- you need to link all the obs text with the player.txt, mode.txt, etc...
- make sure the clock in obs is called clocktext
- directory names for the whitelist are code specific
- requires you to enable websockets for obs and install the python obswebsockets package
- can mess with variables at the top of the overlay.py file
- overlay.py automatically unhids the clocktext when the game starts (after warmup)

when you run VNL stream you must change the timer script in OBS to 10 minutes
when you run KZT stream you must change the timer script in OBS to 5 minutes
