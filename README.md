### Notes:
- run overlay.py in the terminal once everything is setup.
- overlay.py will automatically upload download amandin.txt (data containing times/maps)
- you need to link all the obs text with the player.txt, mode.txt, etc...
- make sure the clock in obs is called clocktext
- directory names for the whitelist are code specific
- requires you to enable websockets for obs and install the python obswebsockets package
- can mess with variables at the top of the overlay.py file
- overlay.py automatically unhids the clocktext when the game starts (after warmup)

change the timer script in OBS to time variable in overlay.py
